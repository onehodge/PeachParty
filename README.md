# PeachParty

Peach Party is a two-player game set in a board game-like world. Players control Peach and Yoshi, collecting coins and stars while avoiding baddies

. The game has nine different boards with unique challenges. Rolling a 10-sided virtual die determines how far the players move. The game board has special squares with unique powers that activate when landed upon or walked over. The winner is the player with the most stars and coins after 99 seconds of gameplay.

Peach Party is a fun and engaging game that challenges players to balance collecting, avoiding, and strategizing. Below is a screenshot of the game:

We can see a Boo - a baddie - in the bottom left corner, with Yoshi (the green fellow with brown shoes) to that Boo's right. Peach can be seen in her pink dress up and to the right of them. Bowser is hanging out in the left column of the board midway down. 

We also see Blue Coin Squares (which give coins), Red Coin Squares (which take coins), Star Squares which give stars, Event Squares(!) which choose from 3 random effects when players land on them - teleport, swap position, or giving a vortex, a Bank Square (green with yellow center) that takes deposits or withdrawals, and Directional Squares (with arrows) which change Peach and Yoshi's direction.

The player controlling Peach uses the following keys to direct her activity:

- To roll the die: Tab key
- To choose a left-fork on the board: the 'a' key
- To choose a right-fork on the board: the 'd' key
- To choose the up-fork on the board: the 'w' key
-  choose the down-fork on the board: the 's' key
- To fire a Vortex projectile in the current direction (if Peach has one): the back quote ` key

The player controlling Yoshi uses the following keys to direct his activity:

- To roll the die: Enter key 
- To choose a left-fork on the board: left arrow key
- To choose a right-fork on the board: right arrow key
- To choose the up-fork on the board: up arrow key
- To choose the down-fork on the board: down arrow key
- To fire a Vortex projectile in the current direction (if Yoshi has one): the backslash \ key
